Projects Realted to Data Mining

Exciting Data Mining Project Alert 

I'm thrilled to share the details of  latest project â€“ "Clustering & PCA Analysis." 

Clustering - Digital Ads Data:
Used clustering techniques to segment ads into homogeneous groups based on critical digital marketing metrics - CPM, CPC, and CTR. The objective was to extract insights for more effective marketing strategies. 

Steps Taken:

Data Exploration:Began by exploring the dataset, checking for missing values, outliers, and gaining a deep understanding of the data's structure.
Missing Value Imputation:Employed a customized function to impute missing values in CPM, CPC, and CTR, based on given formulas.
Outlier Analysis: Deciding whether to treat outliers in K-Means clustering involved analytical judgment, considering their impact on the clustering process.
Z-Score Scaling:Evaluated the effect of z-score scaling on algorithm speed, ensuring efficient data processing.
Hierarchical Clustering: Constructed a dendrogram using WARD and Euclidean distance.
Elbow Plot: Determined the optimum number of clusters for K-Means through an elbow plot.
Silhouette Scores: Calculated silhouette scores for up to 10 clusters, identifying the best configuration.
Profiling Clusters: Profiled the ads based on the optimum number of clusters, revealing trends in clicks, spend, revenue, CPM, CTR, and CPC based on device type. 

PCA - India Census Data:
Also took on the monumental task of analyzing India Census data, loaded with variables. Objective was to perform detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and identify the optimum principal components that explain the most variance in the data. Using Sklearn, we delved into this vast dataset, making sense of it.

The journey was challenging, but the insights gained were immensely rewarding. 

This project has broadened my nalytical horizons, enriched my data mining skills, and reinforced the importance of analytical judgment in the decision-making proces. Excited to share my detailed findings and learnings with you all.
